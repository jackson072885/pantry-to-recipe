# Pantry-to-Recipe

Pantry-to-Recipe is an inventory-aware cooking app that only shows
recipes a user can cook with the ingredients they currently have.

Core ideas:
- Track pantry inventory
- Filter recipes by cuisine, ingredients, and attributes
- Only show recipes that are cookable (or almost cookable)
- Cooking a recipe automatically deducts ingredients

This repository currently contains project structure and design
decisions before implementation begins.
