"""
Cook engine for Pantry-to-Recipe.

This service will later:
- Evaluate whether a recipe can be cooked
- Verify pantry inventory sufficiency
- Deduct ingredients atomically
- Write audit log entries for every inventory change
- Record cook events

This file will contain the core business logic
and must remain deterministic and transaction-safe.

No executable code yet.
